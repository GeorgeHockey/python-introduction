# ## Problem: Print value if negative
# 
# Draw a standard normal value using `np.random.standard_normal` and print the

# ## Problem: 
# 
# Draw a standard t random variable with 2 degrees of freedom using
# `np.random.standard_t(2)` and print "Negative Outlier" if less than -2,
# "Positive Outlier" if larger than 2, and "Inlier" if between -2 and 2.
