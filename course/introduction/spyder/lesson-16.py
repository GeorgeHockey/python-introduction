# ## Problem: Reading in data with Dates
# 
# Read in the files `GS10.csv` and `GS10.xls` which have both been downloaded
# from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).




# ## Problem: Converting Dates
# 
# 1. Load the CSV file without converting the dates in `read_csv`.
# 2. Convert the date column, remove it from the DataFrame, and set it as the
#    index.
