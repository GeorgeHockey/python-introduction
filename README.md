# Introduction to Python

The repository contains a set of notebooks that provide an introduction to Python.
This site contains both an introduction and a course focused on using Python
in Finance and Econometrics.

## Course Materials

The introduction is contained in the Jupyter notebook files that are located
in the directory course/introduction. These files can be used in VS Code or
PyCharm Professional, or (not recommended) Jupyter notebook.  

A complete set of solutions is available in the solutions folder. 

### Spyder
 
Spyder does not provide support for importing notebooks and the extension
that allows notebooks to be used in Spyder is less developed than the 
approach used in VS Code or PyCharm.  The folder spyder contains the notebooks
exported to Python code.
